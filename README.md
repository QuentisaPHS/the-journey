# The Journey  

This repository documents my path into technology â€” from completing my GED to building real-world IT projects and pursuing cloud/network engineering.  

Here youâ€™ll find:  
- ðŸ“š Study notes and certification prep (CompTIA, networking, security)  
- ðŸ›  Hands-on lab projects and experiments  
- ðŸš€ Reflections on milestones and lessons learned  
- ðŸŒ± A transparent record of growth from student â†’ consultant â†’ future architect  

Iâ€™m building PHS Tech Consulting while also investing in my long-term vision: creating innovative, future-ready IT solutions. This repo is a space to share the authentic journey with recruiters, collaborators, and anyone who values growth.
