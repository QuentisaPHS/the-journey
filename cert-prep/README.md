# Certification Prep

This folder documents my preparation for industry certifications, starting with the CompTIA stack (ITF+, A+, Network+, Security+) and continuing into cloud and advanced tracks.  

Here youâ€™ll find study notes, practice labs, and resources Iâ€™ve used to sharpen my skills.  
Think of this as both a record of learning and a guide for others following the same path.
